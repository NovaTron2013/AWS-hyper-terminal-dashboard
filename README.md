# AWS-hyper-terminal-dashboard
The django based project that I worked on for my NIOT internship. Its not perfect by any means or could even be considered trash or a mistake. But hey I'm a mistake as well :) This program helps the user connect and work with AWS's data in 3 different modes. (I'll try to explain more in README)
